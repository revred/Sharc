  "Where the mind is free to imagine and the craft is guided by clarity, code awakens."            |

  A collaborative work shaped by Artificial Intelligence and curated with intent by Ram Revanur.
  Software here is treated not as static text, but as a living system designed to learn and evolve.
  Built on the belief that architecture and context often define outcomes before code is written.

  This file reflects an AI-aware, agentic, context-driven, and continuously evolving approach
  to modern engineering. If you seek to transform a traditional codebase into an adaptive,
  intelligence-guided system, you may find resonance in these patterns and principles.

  Subtle conversations often begin with a single message â€” or a prompt with the right context.
