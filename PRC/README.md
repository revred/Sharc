# PRC (Process, Requests, Comments)

This directory contains **Process, Requests, and Comments**. It serves as the engineering log and design repository for Sharc.

> **Note**: Documents in this folder are **snapshots in time**. They represent design intent, architectural decisions, and execution plans. Unlike `docs/`, which reflects the *current* state of the code, `PRC/` may contain historical context or future plans.

## Key Documents

*   [**Architecture Overview**](ArchitectureOverview.md): The deep engineering manual.
*   [**Execution Plan**](ExecutionPlan.md): The roadmap and milestone tracking.
*   [**Decision Log**](DecisionLog.md): "Why did we do X?" — The history of architectural decisions.

## Specifications
*   [**Graph Support**](GraphSupport.md): Design for the Graph Engine.
*   [**WAL Design**](WALDesign.md): Write-Ahead Log implementation details.
*   [**Encryption Spec**](EncryptionSpec.md): AES-256-GCM paging spec.

## Backlog & Planning
