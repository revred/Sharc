# Announcing Sharc: The Database for AI Agents

We are thrilled to unveil Phase 2 of **Sharc**, the high-performance, trust-aware database built specifically for the next generation of AI agents.

## Why Sharc?
As AI moves from centralized servers to the edge, the browser is becoming the primary execution environment for agents. Sharc bridges the gap between raw performance and cryptographic trust.

### What's New in Phase 2?
- **AI-Centric Arena**: Our interactive benchmarking platform now features AI-specific scenarios, proving Sharc's dominance in "Context Retrieval" and "Memory Seeking".
- **The Trust Layer**: Cryptographic self-attestation is now live. Agents can sign their memories using HMAC-SHA256, creating a verifiable, tamper-evident trail of thought.
- **Dynamic Growth**: Sharc's in-memory storage now scales dynamically, allowing your agents' memories to grow without limits.

## Join the AI Revolution
Sharc is more than just a database; it's the foundation for **Context Space Engineering**. Whether you're building personal assistants, autonomous researchers, or distributed agents, Sharc provides the speed and trust you need.
