# Sharc Execution Plan — February 14, 2026

Based on the goal of making Sharc a Trustworthy Context Transport Layer.

---

## Stream A: SOLID Refactoring of Entire Sharc Foundation, core and extension infrastructure
Goal: Remove reflection fragility and hardcoded strings.

- [x] A1: Use `nameof()` and expression-based MethodInfo discovery.
- [x] A2: Decompose `FilterStarCompiler` into specialized Strategy builders.
- [x] A3: Improve type safety for `ReadOnlySpan` interactions in JIT.
- [x] A4: Registry-based Extension Infrastructure (ISharcExtension, ExtensionRegistry).
- [x] A5: Foundation: Zero-Alloc Resource Management (ISharcBufferPool, Arena).
- [x] A6: Header & Constants Refactoring (SQLiteLayout centralization).
- [x] A7: Decoder Pluggability (IRecordDecoder abstraction improvements).

## Stream B: ACID Compliance
Goal: Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable writes.

- [x] B1: Atomic commit engine (Shadowing Pager or WAL).
- [x] B2: Write transactions in `SharcDatabase`.
- [x] B3: Durability testing with forced process termination.
- [ ] B4: Benchmark against SurrealDB (Write throughput/latency).

## Stream C: Agent Trust Layer
Goal: Context sharing with provenance and reliability scoring.

- [ ] C1: Implement `DistributedLedger` on top of Sharc B-trees.
- [ ] C2: Context sharing API for CLI agents.
- [ ] C3: Trust Scoring logic: `Trust = (Correct Inferences) - (Provable Errors * Penalty)`.
- [ ] C4: Row-Level Entitlement (RLE) via Invasive JIT Filtering.
- [ ] C5: Cryptographic Attribution (Who/What/When) via Digital Signatures.

## Stream D: Arena Playground
Goal: Visualizing the trust network.

- [ ] D1: Dashboard showing real-time agent trust metrics.
- [ ] D2: Visualizer for the distributed ledger structure.
- [ ] D3: Interactive "Context Share" simulation.
